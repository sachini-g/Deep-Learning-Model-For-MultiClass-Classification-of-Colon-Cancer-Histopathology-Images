# Deep-Learning-Model-For-MultiClass-Classification-of-Colon-Cancer-Histopathology-Images
 In this study, a deep learning based multi class classification system is proposed to  automatically classify colorectal histopathological images into six classes.The model was trained and evaluated using a dataset of 2228 H&amp;E stained  colon tissue images captured at 400× magnification.
